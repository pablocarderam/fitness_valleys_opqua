## Project changelog

### 11 Dec 2021
Renamed files. Updated figures 4 and 5 to have a more consistent set of
parameters throughout study. Added supplementary figures S1, S3, S4.
This iteration runs on Opqua v0.9.5.

Removing timecourse LFS zip temporarily.

### 10 Nov 2021
Got Git LFS to finally push correctly thanks to
```bash
git push -f --no-verify
```
obtained from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57715457/git-lfs-files-not-pushing-to-remote-repo).

### 10 Nov 2021
Initial commit. Upload all files used for current draft. Did not upload
